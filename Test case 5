#Test case 5
# Test Case 4 for Display Payment Receipt for Ticket Purchase


# Create a visitor
visitor = Visitor("Reem Ali", 20, "Emarati")
# Create an exhibition
exhibition = Exhibition(["The Starry Night", "The Persistence of Memory"], "Permanent Gallery", "Ongoing")


ticket = Ticket(visitor, exhibition=exhibition)# Purchase tickets for exhibition


ticket_price = TicketPricing.calculate_price(visitor)# Calculate ticket price


total_price = TicketPricing.apply_vat(ticket_price)# Apply VAT


# Print payment receipt details
print("Visitor:", ticket.visitor.name)
print("Exhibition Location:", ticket.exhibition.location)
print("Exhibition Duration:", ticket.exhibition.duration)
print("Ticket Price (before VAT):", ticket_price)
print("Total Price (after VAT):", total_price)


# payment receipt is displayed correctly
assert total_price == 66.15  # 63 AED ticket price + 5% VAT
